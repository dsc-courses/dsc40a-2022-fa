Hi my name is Mahdi Soleymani. I am a postdoctoral scholar at HDSI, and my research interest lies in the intersection of machine learning and information theory. I received my B.S. and M.S. degrees from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2014 and 2016, respectively, and my Ph.D. degree from the University of Michigan Ann Arbor in 2022, all in electrical engineering. I am passionate about doing fundamental research and teaching theoretical courses, and I am fortunate to be one of the instructors of DSC 40A this semester. I enjoy listening to music, reading books, and hiking in my free time. I am looking forward to meeting you in the class.
