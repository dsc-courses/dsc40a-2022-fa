Hi everyone! My name is Yujia(Joy), and Iâ€™m a third-year student double majoring in Data Science and Math&Econ. I was born and raised in China for the first fourteen years of my life, then my family moved to San Diego and we are still living in this beautiful city. I have some experience tutoring when I was in high school, but it was my first time being a tutor at UCSD. I am excited to tutor for DSC 40 A, and I am willing to provide as much help as possible to everyone in this class. I look forward to meeting you all, and please feel free to reach out if you have any questions!
