Hey everyone! My name is Vivian, and I am a third-year Data Science major with a minor in Business. I am originally from South Bay Area but now reside in Orange County. When Iâ€™m not in front of my laptop, I love to explore SD with friends, binge TV shows, play tennis and basketball, kayak, and drink lattes. Feel free to come to my OH with any questions or just to do work/say hi!
