Hey everyone! I'm Shiv and I'm a fourth-year Data Science major. I grew up in Singapore before moving to San Diego. I love watching TV shows, playing board games, and going on walks in my free time!

I look forward to meeting all of you this quarter, and please feel free to stop by my office hours if you're having any difficulty with the course, or even if you just want to chat!
