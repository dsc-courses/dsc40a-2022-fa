I’m Karthikeya and I'm a senior year Data Science major. I’m originally from Hyderabad, India. This is my 6th quarter as a tutor — I have tutored DSC 10 and DSC 80 in the past. Some of my interests within data science include machine learning and data visualization — particularly in the fields of business analytics and sports analytics.
