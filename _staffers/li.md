*If you love ðŸ¥‘, you are in the right course!* 

Hi, I'm Larry from Shenzhen, China. I'm a junior double majoring in Data Science and Math-Econ. DSC 40A is the most useful course that will prepare you for studying the math behind advanced machine learning & deep learning models and I cannot wait to relearn it with you all! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions!
